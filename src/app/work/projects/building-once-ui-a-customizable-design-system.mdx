**Fall 2025**

## Overview

Recognizing a gap in the local winter sports market for affordable, high-quality equipment maintenance, I founded **Glide**, a direct-to-consumer ski waxing and tuning service. While traditional shops often have long turnaround times and opaque pricing, I identified an opportunity to serve the BYU and Utah Valley student community with a streamlined, transparent, and convenient digital-first solution. Glide combines a custom-built web interface with professional-grade service execution to optimize the ski ownership experience.

## Key Projects

### Product Strategy & Market Validation

* Conducted competitive analysis of local ski shops and resort tuning centers to identify pricing inefficiencies and service gaps.

* Defined the "convenience-first" value proposition, targeting busy students and recreational skiers who value quick turnaround times.

* Structured a tiered pricing model based on material costs (temperature-specific waxes) and labor time (edge tuning vs. standard wax).

### Web Development & UX Design

* Designed and deployed a responsive website to handle service inquiries, pricing transparency, and customer education.

* Implemented a clean, user-centric interface that simplifies the intake process, reducing friction for potential customers.

* Optimized site content for local SEO to capture traffic from skiers in the Provo/Park City area.

### Operations & Quality Control

* Established a supply chain for professional-grade tuning equipment, including specific edge-beveling tools and temperature-sensitive hydrocarbon waxes.

* Developed a standardized "intake-to-delivery" workflow to ensure consistent quality control and minimize service time per pair of skis.

* Created educational content to help customers understand the technical benefits of regular edge maintenance and base hydration.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the primary challenges was balancing technical web development with physical service constraints. I learned that while a digital storefront drives acquisition, the operational bottleneck lies in the physical labor of precision tuning. This required iterating on the business model to limit intake volume during peak storm cycles to maintain quality standards. Additionally, I gained significant experience in "learning by building," utilizing AI tools to accelerate the development of the web platform despite not being a full-stack engineer.

## Outcome

Glide successfully launched as a functional service-based business, validating the demand for a tech-enabled alternative to traditional ski shops. The project served as a live case study in end-to-end product management—from ideation and technical implementation to operational execution and customer acquisition—demonstrating the viability of a lean, student-run venture in the competitive outdoor industry.
