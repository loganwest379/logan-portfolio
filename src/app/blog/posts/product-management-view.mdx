## Understanding the Customer

I believe that a great product manager's first priority is truly understanding the customer. This means doing everything possible to stay aligned with customers' needs and avoiding the trap of building something they don't actually want. 

Many product managers fall into the trap of thinking they know what's best, or they focus on small details they believe will help. However, this mindset often fails because they're not deeply connected with the customers. The key is to have continuous conversations with customers, understanding their pain points, and ensuring that when they bring up new points, it isn't surprising because you're already in sync with their needs.

I've learned that customer inclinations are usually more correct than our assumptions. It's essential to focus on the customer's perspective and validate our assumptions through direct interaction and feedback.

## Speed Over Perfection

The second critical principle I believe makes a great product manager is a focus on speed. It's better to launch and iterate than to build the perfect product that you believe customers will love. 

One of my personal areas for growth has been recognizing that I sometimes want to focus on the best output. However, I've learned that focusing on speed allows for faster iteration and learning. This is career-changing advice that I believe will significantly impact my career trajectory.

The concept of one-way vs. two-way doors is particularly insightful—for every decision, check if it's a one-way or two-way door. Many decisions can be reversed, so it's better to move quickly, learn, and adjust rather than wait for perfection.

## Focusing on Inputs, Not Outputs

Success in product management comes from focusing on inputs rather than outputs. There are many things we cannot control, and when we focus on outputs, we lose control. Instead, we should focus on the inputs we can control—the processes, the customer conversations, the quality of our discovery, and how we work with our teams.

You'll know you're succeeding as a product manager when you feel like you understand customers well, when new points from customers aren't surprising because you're continuously talking with them, and when you're focusing on the right inputs rather than being fixated on outputs.

## The Core Resources

A product manager's success depends on being connected to the key resources: customers, designers, engineers, and stakeholders. A terrible product manager is one who is not connected to these critical resources. Great product management is about being the bridge between these groups, facilitating communication, and ensuring everyone is aligned toward a common goal.

Product management offers incredible autonomy—you get to be deeply connected to both the customer and your team, while also making big decisions and facilitating significant impact for the company. The role is the perfect bridge between working with customers and delivering the best product.

## Personal Growth

My journey in product management has taught me that there are many different ways to be a "successful" product manager. If you bring your unique attributes to the workforce, you can bring something great to any company. Product management isn't about following a single template—it's about combining your strengths with core principles to create meaningful impact.

I'm passionate about product management and excited about building a career in it. The lessons I've learned from experienced product managers and through my own experiences have shaped my understanding of what it means to excel in this field.
