## Overview

During my internship at Brevium, I identified a critical gap in our billing infrastructure that was causing high-value client churn. Our legacy systems could not support the complex billing structures required by large Private Equity groups. I led the end-to-end discovery and development of a new Enterprise Billing Feature, bridging the gap between customer needs and technical execution. This initiative was not just an operational upgrade but a strategic move to win back a top-tier client who had previously left due to these limitations.

## Key Projects

### Stakeholder Discovery & Requirements

* Collaborated closely with Account Executives and internal stakeholders to diagnose the root causes of client dissatisfaction.

* Conducted deep-dive interviews to gather specific billing requirements, translating complex financial needs into clear technical specifications.

* Identified the specific feature set required to re-engage a major Private Equity client, directly influencing the decision to prioritize this project on the roadmap.

### Product Planning & Execution

* Owned the product lifecycle from 0 to 1, creating comprehensive PRDs and mapping out the development roadmap.

* Managed a team of four engineers, translating requirements into actionable Jira tickets and organizing bi-weekly sprints.

* Facilitated daily stand-ups and grooming sessions to ensure the engineering team had clarity on acceptance criteria and technical constraints.

### Process Optimization

* Designed a unified billing system that consolidated multiple legacy platforms, reducing manual administrative work.

* Streamlined the internal billing workflow, which was projected to save the finance team 6+ hours of manual labor weekly.

* Established a new standard for documentation and project handoffs, ensuring the team could continue execution seamlessly after my internship concluded.

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was navigating the ambiguity of replacing a legacy system while keeping the "plane flying" for existing customers. I learned how to balance aggressive business goals (winning back the client) with technical reality (refactoring old code). Additionally, leading a 4-engineer team taught me the importance of over-communicating context—engineers didn't just need to know what to build, but why it mattered for the business revenue.

## Outcome

The project successfully halted the churn of a top-revenue Private Equity client, who agreed to return to Brevium based on the roadmap and prototype of this feature. By leading the discovery and initial execution, I laid the foundation for a scalable enterprise billing engine that not only recovered lost revenue but also future-proofed the platform for larger institutional clients.
